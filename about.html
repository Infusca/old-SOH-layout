            <img id="my-image" src="images/me_sc.jpg">
            <p> I am a pharmacist currently working for Walgreens. I have worked for Walgreens for about four years, since the company transitioned from Rite Aid. I was with Rite Aid originally since 2005 when I was an intern in college. </p>
            <p> In my free time I enjoy programming, gaming, photography, reading, biking, wood turning, guitar, piano, metal detecting, cooking, yard work, traveling, hiking, and camping. However, there's too many things to do and not enough time to do them! </p>
            <p> I enjoy collecting rocks, fossils, artifacts, and of course coins and relics I find metal detecting. </p></p>
            <p> I love all animals, but especially wolves and cats and dinosaurs. </p>
            <p> This website is a collection of everything Me. </p>
            <p> The title comes from a lyric from one of my favorite songs from one of my favorite bands: Fire Woman by The Cult. </p>

          <p>Stef was originally an insurance agent for Smith Brothers but has quit that to pursue a career in metal detecting. She has worked really hard via social media to grow a following and get affiliated with MineLab (one of the largest metal detecting companies). She is now a MineLab Detexpert <a href="https://www.minelab.com/usa/community/meet-the-detexperts/stef-tanguay" target="new window"> <img src="images/about/minelab-logo.png" alt="MineLab Logo" style="width:50px"> </a>and works for a dealer to sell metal detectors and equipment. She has a youtube channel showing what she finds while detecting. She is a very talented writer as well and has written several articles for Digger Magazine and has submitted some of her finds for the magazine as well as various book. She also is a talented musician, albeit out of practice, and can play bass, guitar, and drums. </p>

          <h6> Travel <span style="font-size: 8px; text-align: right"></span></h6>
            <div class="">
              <p> I love to travel and see the world. I really wish I did more of it, but alas... This section is just to point out the places I have been. I may add a travel section to this website actually and put up photos from my adventures. Just thought of that now and what better place to keep a record of my travels? </p>
              <p> SOUTH AFRICA. My mom's cousins and their families live here. I've been 3 times and it's one of my favorite places. My family is lucky and has access to a private reserve in the african bush. No other people. Just us. And nature. I love the isolation. The fact that if you walk alone into the bush you may very well be eaten by a lion, or trampled by an elephant. How exciting. When you come out of your hut in the morning and see hyena footprints all around camp. Our last trip we made was amazing with lion sitings. So much so that we had an entire road to ourselves driving through Kruger Park (no other cars, which is rare, especially with a lion siting) and got to drive for about 20 minutes side by side with a lioness walking down the road. A truly amazing experience that will likely never happen again in my life. I will never forget it. I love hunting for impala. I haven't hunted myself but I enjoy going on the missions. Also an amazing experience, while sitting in the jeep, to watch my uncle Simon walk into the bush to stalk impala and see a hyena come out of the bush, stand right in front of our jeep, watching Simon and start following him in. What an experience. Not to mention putting out the impala guts near camp to attract the hyenas (and vultures) so we can get some good sitings. I love it. </p>
              <p> DOMINICA. I haven't been in a very long time, but I do miss it. My aunt and uncle live here. It's a very beautiful, small island with a friendly community and great diving and nature experiences. Check out <a href="https://natureislanddive.dm/" target="new window">Nature Island Dive</a>; my aunt and uncle have a little coffee shop there with delicious lion fish burgers (not that I've gotten to try one yet). They do scuba diving tours and certifications there and work very hard to protect the beautiful reefs. </p>
              <p> DOMINICAN REPUBLIC. My grandma lives here. I've been several times. I have never visited the touristy parts because that's not my how my family do. I'm lucky enough to have family in all these places so we get to stay local for free or close to it. It's always nice to see my grandma, and possibly other family, and have breakfast and lunch on the beach, oh and then happy hour, and then dinner at a local restaurant. Always a very relaxing vacation to just enjoy being with family. </p>
              <p> ITALY. I went here for my senior class trip in high school. A great experience but I would really love to go again some day. I love how ancient all of europe is. Truly amazing.</p>
              <p> ENGLAND. Another place I would like to visit again eventually. My mom and grandma are from here. </p>
              <p> FRANCE. I only came here for a few hours on a ferry from either England or Italy (I can't remember at the moment). I would love to actually visit France one day. I love the language. I don't know why but the french have always appealed to me lol. Maybe it's their cheese. </p>
              <p> GREECE. I was 3. I only have a memory of watching my parents swimming away in the ocean as I sat on the beach. I guess you could say that's my earliest memory. I'd love to visit again. My grandpa lived here. </p>
              <p> CANADA. I visited here when my grandma lived here before she moved to the Dominican Republic. </p>
